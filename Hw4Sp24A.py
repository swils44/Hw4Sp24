"""
A fancy, nice little problem statement:

P(x<1|N(0,1)) 
    - the probability that x is less than 1
    - (mean) μ = 0 and (standard deviation) σ = 1
P(x>μ+2σ|N(175, 3))
    - the probability that x is greater than the mean + 2 times σ
    - (mean) μ = 175 and (standard deviation) σ = 3
We are going to plot this using some libraries. Specifically, scipy stats, numpy,
and matplotlib

We should "explore" stats.norm().pdf and stat.norm().cdf

    Calculate the PDF and CDF for our two P()

    I opted to make this modular by making the calculations one function and the plotting functions another. This makes
    it not only more readable but allows me to call the functions in the future if I need to without the need to
    duplicate the function.

    I moved things around from my initial program to make sure I was doing this after realizing I had plots and
    calculations all scattered around when trying to program after an already 16-hour work day. After a solid "oh, duh"
    moment and lots of cleaning up it should make a lot of sense.

    Here we use the CDF/PDF functions to find the probabilities associated with the range of values in the
    distribution. I felt like the function name was awesome and appropriate since we are finding the statistical
    bits here.
